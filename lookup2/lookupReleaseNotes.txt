- validate ISBN on entry before sending form to MARC server. This prevents having a 
  lookup failure due to a typing error appear as if no database entry exists.
- as an interim solution to the multiple hit problem, all hits will be posted to all 
  tag fields.  This usually results in duplicates of most values, but at least nothing
  is lost or hidden.  If you have a better display idea, please let me know.  To see 
  the effect on a known case, try ISBN "188-127-3156", which was provided by Ivan.

2004-09-21 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed bug in lookup regarding hit counter.

- To have focus in lookup so it appears in lookup value field as it did in ver 0.4,
  You should modify biblio_new_form.php to the following:
  $tab = "cataloging";
  $nav = "new";
  $helpPage = "biblioEdit";
  $cancelLocation = "../catalog/index.php";

	if (!isset($HTTP_GET_VARS["lookupVal"]) && !isset($HTTP_GET_VARS["srchBy"])) 
		$focus_form_name = "lookupform";
		$focus_form_field = "lookupVal";
	} else {
		$focus_form_name = "newbiblioform";
		$focus_form_field = "materialCd";
	}

  require_once("../shared/read_settings.php");
  require_once("../functions/inputFuncs.php");

2004-07-11 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
- code modified to work with ver 0.5

2004-04-04 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Use of '-' in ISBN or LCCN now allowed, but not required.
- Removed leading '; ' from 1st additional author.
- Added note asking that lookup value be saved in the event of multiple hits.  A test
	case is needed to write code to handle this frequent problem.
- Major simplification of "extract_marc_fields()" function using generic code for all 
	MARC fields except 538(Systems Details Note) & 650(Topical Term).  538 is not
	normally handled by OpenBiblio at all, and 650 data is handled outside of MARC.

- if you would like to have the "new copy" form automatically appear when finished
	adding new bibliographic data, change the end of "biblio_new.php" to read:
  
  #**************************************************************************
  #*  Must select one of the following lines
  #**************************************************************************
  //following line requires manual access to new copy form (original function)
  //header("Location: ../shared/biblio_view.php?bibid=".$bibid."&msg=".$msg);
  //following line auto transfers to new copy form (new function)
  header("Location: ../catalog/biblio_copy_new_form.php?bibid=".$bibid."&msg=".$msg);
  exit();
 
2003-08-11 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added 'my_call_nmbr_type' variable to top of lookup.php to allow user to select 
	which of LoC, Dewey, or local call numbers are to be placed into the Call_Nmbr1,2,3 fields.
	Thanks to Richard June for the idea.
- Corrected the Z3950 search_by attribute for LCCN to be '9'.  Thanks to A.J. Gatlin.
- Added handler for tag 538a at popular request. (Matt & Richard)
- Temporarily disabled for() loop for handling multiple records since it performed no
	useful function as written.  Also commented out residual <dl></dl> pair

2003-08-04 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Code has been thoroughly tested with 0.40.  I have added some 30 books using
this version, perhaps 10 of those using a cuecat bar code reader to enter the 
ISBN from the book jacket or inside cover.

Be sure to follow the recommendations at the bottom of this document regarding
session_data and implementing YAZ in your PHP.

Fixed a problem when the remote server provides 2 or more LoC Call numbers for
a single book.  They are now seperated by '; '.

Now supports 'Additional authors' if you change biblio_fields.php as follows:
  <?php printUsmarcInputText(100,"a",TRUE,$fieldIds,$postVars,$pageErrors,$marcTags, $marcSubflds, FALSE,OBIB_TEXT_CNTRL);?>

  <?php // added for additional authors (fl) ?>
  <?php printUsmarcInputText(700,"a",FALSE,$fieldIds,$postVars,$pageErrors,$marcTags, $marcSubflds, FALSE,OBIB_TEXT_CNTRL);?>

  <?php printUsmarcInputText(650,"a",FALSE,$fieldIds,$postVars,$pageErrors,$marcTags, $marcSubflds, FALSE,OBIB_TEXT_CNTRL);?>
  
I found it convenient to change the content of the description column of the 
usmarc_subfield_dm table for row 100a to be "Personal name - Author".  I also changed 
the description for row 700a to "Personal name - additional author".

Changed the 'extract_marc_fields()' function to use a switch / case statement in place 
of the long set of if statements.

All documntation comments use the '#' form.  '//' is used only for disabling 
development debug statements.  All of these may be removed if you prefer.

You should modify biblio_new_form.php to the following:
  $helpPage = "biblioEdit";
  $cancelLocation = "../catalog/index.php";

		if (empty($lookupVal) || empty($srchBy)) { ##<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 
			$focus_form_name = "lookupform";
			$focus_form_field = "lookupVal";
		} else {
			$focus_form_name = "newbiblioform";
			$focus_form_field = "materialCd";
		}

  require_once("../shared/read_settings.php");
  require_once("../functions/inputFuncs.php");

Made several other small changes I have forgotten.

2003-07-06 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The tested code is for version 0.30 of OpenBiblio.
I have included a modified version of the php code for 0.4 prepared by Matt Boytim
even though I have not tried it myself.  Also included is an add-on he suggests to 
move the web page focus to the ISBN entry line.

2002-9-18 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. $ removed from prices
2. multiple entries now properly seperated by ';'
3. '00' removed from isbn
4. bar code now filled only with LC control number
5. leading spaces removed from LC cntl number
6. remove title choice from form, reformat and add notes
7. remove some unused code

Known Problems 9-18:
none at this time

===============================================================================
All of the following refers to the 0.30 version.

This is an addon to OpenBiblio that allows you to do a search of a Z3950 
catalog with auto posting of the resulting MARC data to the 'new bibliography' 
page. It's admitidly crude, being my first php effort. This code is an embelishment
of the examples shown at: www.indexdata.dk/phpyaz/. 

This module allows you to specify isbn, lccn or title for the search and the 
value to search for. The input form (all 3 lines of it is placed just above 
the current new_biblio form. Output is directly to the normal input fields 
to allow user verification and editing before submission. Provission is made 
in the code (marked as #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<)to display the actual MARC 
formatted lines, but that is currently disabled by '//' marks. 

In my experience, this search only works for books published since about
1972.  I would guess that US lib of Congress has decided not add isbn or LCCN 
searches to the z3950 server for anything older than that.  For older
books I use 'title + author' using the advanced search at
www.loc.gov/z3950/.

I've added some 1000+ books to my catalog using this code and it definately works 
for me using the Lib of Congress voyager server. Another server could be
easily substituted. Just search for the following and substitute the
server of choice.  

	$host = 	'z3950.loc.gov:7090';
	$database = 	'voyager';

A list of servers can be found at www.loc.gov/z3950/

The mod to openBiblio involves adding this single line to biblio_new_form.php 
just above the existing <form ... > statement near the end of the file. 

<?php include("../catalog/lookup.php");?> 

Then of course you add the lookup.php file to the indicated directory. Thats it! 
(Assuming you have YAZ installed in your php installation.)

While, all may go perfectly for you the first time, I found it useful to make a few
additions to biblio_new.php. Locate the '!validData' string as shown below, and insert
the new lines beginning with 'echo' as shown.

  $validData = $biblio->validateData();
  if (!$validData) {
    echo 'Validation failed!' . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    echo 'one or more of the following has an invalid character:' . '<br>'; #<<<
    echo '  isbn = ' . $HTTP_POST_VARS["isbnNmbr"] . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    echo '  bar Code = ' . $HTTP_POST_VARS["barcodeNmbr"] . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<<<<
    echo '  title = ' . $HTTP_POST_VARS["title"] . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    echo '  call Nmbr = ' . $HTTP_POST_VARS["callNmbr"] . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    echo '  price = ' . $HTTP_POST_VARS["price"] . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    echo 'please correct the invalid entries and try again.' . '<br>'; #<<<<<<<<
    $pageErrors["barcodeNmbr"] = $biblio->getBarcodeNmbrError();
    $pageErrors["title"] = $biblio->getTitleError();
    $pageErrors["callNmbr"] = $biblio->getCallNmbrError();
    $pageErrors["price"] = $biblio->getPriceError();
    $HTTP_SESSION_VARS["postVars"] = $HTTP_POST_VARS;
    $HTTP_SESSION_VARS["pageErrors"] = $pageErrors;
    header("Location: ../catalog/biblio_new_form.php");
    exit();
  }

Then when I do get some incorrect data into the data entry form, I can see what 
caused the problem.


Note: if you are using windows, check that your installation of php created a 
'.../php/sessionData' dir.  OpenBiblio will require it to run correctly.

My installation of php (4.23 for Windows 2000) came with YAZ already
installed. All I needed to do was to move the accompanying yaz.dll to
my c:\winnt\system32 dir. The indexdata page can help with linux/unix
systems.
