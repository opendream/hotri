Circulation with or without barcodes labeled</a>:
<br>
OpenBiblio circulation forms are designed to support efficient circulation when using a barcode scanner and 
<a href="../shared/help.php?page=barcodes">barcodes</a> 
printed on member cards and labeled to copies.
<br>
It is also possible to circulate when barcode numbers are not known; members can be searched by last 
name and OPAC-based 
<a href="../shared/help.php?page=opacLookup">Barcode Lookup</a> 
retrieves a copy's barcode number for Check Out, Check In or Hold.

<a name="late">
Late fee calculated, not notified</a>:
<br>
OpenBiblio does not notify library staff when checking in overdue items and calculating late fee. 
Depending on library rules and the way staff handles OpenBiblio this could lead to unjust late fee 
calculated to a members account. To avoid this go to the Collections page (Admin tab) and set 
Daily Late Fee for all collections to zero.
