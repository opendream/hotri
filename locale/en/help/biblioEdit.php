<h1>Bibliography New and Edit Pages:</h1>
The bibliography new and edit (Edit-Basic) page fields are based on 
the <a href="javascript:popSecondaryLarge('http://www.loc.gov/marc')">MARC 21</a> standard format.  Only
a very small subset of the several hundred MARC fields are included on
this basic edit page to make it easy to add bibliographies.  Once a bibliography
has been added you can then add any of the MARC 21 fields using the Edit-MARC page.
<br><br>
Once you have added a new bibliography you will need to add copies to this
bibliography before the bibliography is available for checkout.
