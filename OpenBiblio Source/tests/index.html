<h1>OpenBiblio Test Suite</h1>
<p><strong style="color: red">WARNING:</strong>
These tests modify the database.  <strong>DO NOT</strong> run the
test suite unless you are willing to lose all your data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests (not in place yet)</li>
<li><a href="selenium/core/TestRunner.html">Functional tests</a>
<p>As useful as these functional tests are, they aren't as robust as they should be.
It's just as likely that failures may indicate errors in the suite as errors in the system.
Also, running the tests many times in succession seems to tickle bugs in both IE and
Firefox, so a browser restart may be necessary.  Look sharp.</p>
<p><strong>IE Note:</strong> The Cataloging test seems to trigger some bad interaction
between IE and Selenium.  I haven't fully investigated yet, but running the test normally
almost always results in some sort of 'permission denied' error from IE.  However, running
the test in single-step mode succeeds.</p>
